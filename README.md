## 🧩 What’s Inside?  
This repo contains the four pillars of modern frontend development:

---

### 🟧 1. **HTML – The Structure**
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the **skeleton of every webpage**.  
It defines the layout, headings, images, paragraphs, forms—everything you see on a screen.  
Without HTML, a webpage is like a house without walls.

✔ Basics to Advanced Tags  
✔ Forms, Tables, Semantic Elements  
✔ Real-world examples

---

### 🎨 2. **CSS – The Style**
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) brings **life, color, and beauty** to the structure.  
It handles spacing, colors, animations, responsiveness, layouts and much more.

✔ Flexbox, Grid  
✔ Colors, Typography  
✔ Animations, Transitions  
✔ Making websites responsive

---

### 🎀 3. **Bootstrap – The Ready-Made Styling Power**
Bootstrap is like **CSS with superpowers**—predefined layouts, buttons, grids, cards, modals, alerts, and everything responsive by default.

Perfect for beginners who want quick results and professionals who want speed.

✔ Prebuilt components  
✔ Mobile-first design  
✔ Faster UI development  
✔ Professional layout system

---

### 🟦 4. **JavaScript – The Brain**
JavaScript adds **logic and interactivity** to websites—making them alive.  
Everything dynamic you see on a site (sliders, forms, events, menus, calculations) relies on JavaScript.

✔ Variables, Operators, Functions  
✔ DOM Manipulation  
✔ Events  
✔ Mini Projects & Solutions

## 🧩 Tech Stack Overview  

### HTML  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the **foundation** of the web. It defines the content and structure of web pages — headings, paragraphs, links, lists, forms, media.  
This repo’s `01_HTML/` folder contains beginners’ examples and senior-friendly revision files.

### CSS  
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what gives your web pages **style and polish** — from colors, fonts, layouts, and animations to full responsive design.  
In `02_CSS/` you’ll find styling examples that transform plain HTML into beautiful surfaces.

### Bootstrap  
Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework that speeds up UI building and ensures consistent, responsive design.  
You’ll find the `03_Bootstrap Framework/` folder full of ready-to-use components and layout demos — great for beginners fast-tracking and seniors reviewing modern workflows.

### JavaScript  
JavaScript is the **brain** of the webpage — logic, interaction, events, and dynamic behaviour.  
In the `04_JavaScript/` folder you have curated examples of DOM manipulation, event handling, mini-projects — perfect for exam prep, interviews, or teaching.
