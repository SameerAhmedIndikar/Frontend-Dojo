  <h1>JavaScript Loops</h1>

  <section id="for-loop">
    <h2>For Loop</h2>
    <p>The <strong>for loop</strong> is used when you know in advance how many times the script should run. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.</p>
    <p>Syntax: for (initialization; condition; increment) { code block }</p>
    <p>Example: Loop from 0 to 4, printing each number.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="while-loop">
    <h2>While Loop</h2>
    <p>The <strong>while loop</strong> executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true. The condition is checked before each iteration.</p>
    <p>Syntax: while (condition) { code block }</p>
    <p>Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="do-while-loop"> 
    <h2>Do-While Loop</h2>
    <p>The <strong>do-while loop</strong> is similar to the while loop, but the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition.</p>
    <p>Syntax: do { code block } while (condition);</p>
    <p>Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a do-while loop.</p>
