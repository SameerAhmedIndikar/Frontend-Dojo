<!-- Write a JavaScript program that checks whether a given year is a Leap Year or not.

👉 Conditions for a Leap Year:

A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.

But if the year is also divisible by 100, then it is NOT a leap year.

However, if the year is divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.

Example:

2020 → Leap Year ✅ (divisible by 4, not divisible by 100)

1900 → Not a Leap Year ❌ (divisible by 100 but not by 400)

2000 → Leap Year ✅ (divisible by 400)

2023 → Not a Leap Year ❌ (not divisible by 4) -->
